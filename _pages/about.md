Hi, I am Anas Houssaini and I am a 1st year Computer Science Masters student studying AI/robotics at McGill University. I am advised by Professor David Meger and Professor Hsiu-chin Lin in the Mobile Robotics Lab (MRL). 

My research is driven by a singular obsession: figuring out how robots can build and adapt their own understanding of the world—something that evolves, learns, and gets closer to how humans process their surroundings. Right now, I’m particularly fascinated by bimanual robot manipulation—how two robotic arms can collaborate, coordinate, and assist each other to tackle complex tasks.

"To teach a robot to learn is to teach it to dream. A dream not of wires and circuits, but of understanding, where every action reflects a world it perceives, every failure refines its soul, and every success whispers the promise of a mind unbound" - Me.
